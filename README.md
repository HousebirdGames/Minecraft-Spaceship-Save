# Minecraft Spaceships

Download and extract the `Save and Resourcepack.zip` file to access both the save folder and the resource pack used to build the spaceships.

## Which Minecraft Version to use?

This content is designed for Minecraft Version 1.12.2. Ensure you're running this version to experience the spaceships as intended.

## What's there to explore?

Currently there are five ships to explore and enjoy. Each with its own unique personality and features. All ships come with a wide variety of rooms and some redstone functionality.

## Why is everything written in German?

The project originated when I was younger and less accustomed to using English. I decided to maintain the original language for continuity.

## Installation Guide

If you're unfamiliar with installing Minecraft saves and resourcepacks, here's a quick guide:

1. Download the `Save and Resourcepack.zip`.
2. Extract the contents to your Minecraft directory:
   - The folder inside the Save folder goes into `.minecraft/saves`
   - Resource pack folder into `.minecraft/resourcepacks`
3. Launch Minecraft, select the correct version (1.12.2), and apply the resource ack from the options menu.

Have fun!
